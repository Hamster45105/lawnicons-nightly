## Contributing
If you can help improve the [GitHub action](https://github.com/Hamster45105/lawnicons-nightly/blob/main/.github/workflows/daily_release.yml) in any way, please fork and make a pull request.

If you just find this helpful, please give a star!

## Is the APK uploaded to the releases tampered with or changed?
No, you can verify this yourself by going reviewing the [GitHub action](/.github/workflows/daily_release.yml) that automates the releases. As you can see, the APK for the releases is downloaded directly from the `Build Debug APK` GitHub action run on the Lawnicons repository.

If you still don't believe me, then to double check the authenticity of the APK you can install the app from a trusted location (IzzyOnDroid, the official Lawnicons repo etc..) and then try to install an APK from this repo. If there are no errors and the app installs normally, you can be sure the APK has not been tampered with.

If you STILL don't believe me then there is nothing I can do to convince you.

## Note
